EPIC is the association‘s highest decision-making body. EPIC regularly meets at least once 
in every calendar year. An extraordinary EPIC meeting (EPIC FAIL) takes place if requested 
by at least one third of the members or by the Board. 
EPIC meetings may only make decisions if at least half of the members entitled to vote are 
present or represented. If less than half of the members entitled to vote are present or re-
presented, another EPIC meeting may be called no sooner than 15 calendar days later with 
the same agenda. 
The 5 YPE Statutes, Last update November 2020 second meeting of EPIC shall be entitled 
to take valid decisions irrespective of the number of members with voting rights present or 
represented. EPIC consists of up to two delegates from every member. Every member‘s vote 
has the same weight. Delegates from one member may only cast their vote together.
